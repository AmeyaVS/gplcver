To test the Dinotrace waveform viewer:

BEFORE STARTING:
   Make a binary Cver (see INSTALL or README file in src directory) and
   run the shell script in install.tst directory to verify correct build.
   
   You must also have a dinotrace in the top level bin directory as well.


To run the Dinotrace waveform viewer run 'dino_tst.sh' in this directory.  
If the shell script is passed no arguments, it will run dmp.v by default 
creating a file called verilog.dump, which is then passed to dinotrace to 
view the waveform.  If 'dino_tst.sh dmp2.v', it will create xx.dmp, and run
dinotrace on this file as well. Cver creates verilog.dump by default when
$dumpvars is called, otherise $dumpfile can be called to rename the dump file
as is the case with dmp2.v, renaming the file to xx.dmp.

Different types of $dumpvar calls are commented out in dmp.v, view the file to 
see various dump calls, or consult the LRM for more information. If dinotrace 
doesn't load, or for more infomation see  the README.dinotrace on level up.
